## üåç About

Warcast.app is an advanced real-time conflict monitoring system that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes global military conflicts using cutting-edge AI/ML technologies. In an era of information overload and rapidly evolving global tensions, our platform provides clarity by:

- üì∞ **Aggregating news from 50+ trusted sources** including ACLED verified conflict data
- ü§ñ **AI-powered analysis** using OpenAI (*more models to come) for real-time threat assessment
- üéØ **Intelligent filtering** with configurable threat thresholds to focus on significant events
- üó∫Ô∏è **Entity extraction** identifying countries, organizations, weapons, and key figures
- üìä **Batch processing** analyzing 20 articles simultaneously for efficiency

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Real-time Intelligence
- **Staging architecture** - Two-stage processing for optimal performance
- **30-second processing cycle** - Rapid analysis of staged articles
- **Duplicate detection** - Advanced hash-based deduplication at multiple levels
- **Source aggregation** - Groups similar stories across multiple sources
- **ACLED integration** - Verified conflict event data from academic sources

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Batch AI Processing** - GPT-4o-mini analyzes 20 articles in single API call
- **Rich Entity Extraction** - Identifies:
  - Countries and regions involved
  - Military organizations and groups
  - Key political figures and leaders
  - Weapons systems and military assets
- **Advanced Threat Scoring** - 0-100 scale based on:
  - Military action indicators
  - Nuclear threat detection
  - Cyber warfare mentions
  - Terrorism indicators
- **Key Phrase Extraction** - Captures critical context from each article
- **Local vs Global Classification** - Filters out local incidents to focus on geopolitical events

### Advanced Features

- **Configurable Threat Filtering** - Minimum score threshold (default: 25/100)
- **Interactive Entity Display** - Color-coded badges for countries, organizations, weapons
- **Detailed AI Analysis Modal** - Shows full assessment with threat indicators
- **Performance Optimizations** - Database indexes, batch operations, pre-filtering
- **Web3 - Solana Wallet Connect** - Access to restricted areas only by wallet login (more blockchain integrations to come)
- **Mobile Responsive** - Full functionality on all devices

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Lucide icons
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering, optimized caching

#### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Language**: Python
- **Database**: MariaDB 10.3 with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Caching**: Redis with automatic invalidation
- **Migrations**: Alembic for database versioning
- **Task Scheduling**: AsyncIO-based background tasks
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt hashing

#### AI/ML Pipeline
- **Text Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API exclusively
- **Batch Processing**: Analyzes 20 articles per API call
- **Staging Architecture**: Two-stage pipeline for efficiency:
  1. RSS aggregation ‚Üí staged_news_items table
  2. AI analysis ‚Üí news_items table (filtered by threat score)
- **Comprehensive Analysis**:
  - Threat score (0-100) with configurable threshold
  - Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Entity extraction (countries, orgs, people, weapons)
  - Key phrase identification (max 5 per article)
  - Threat indicator flags (military, nuclear, cyber, terrorism)
  - Local incident detection to filter non-geopolitical news

### Data Flow

1. **News Aggregation** ‚Üí RSS feeds fetched into staging table
2. **Pre-filtering** ‚Üí Excludes non-relevant content (sports, entertainment, etc.)
3. **Deduplication** ‚Üí Hash-based duplicate detection at staging level
4. **Batch AI Analysis** ‚Üí GPT-4o-mini processes 20 articles at once
5. **Threat Filtering** ‚Üí Only articles scoring ‚â•25/100 are saved
6. **Entity Enrichment** ‚Üí Extracts and stores structured entity data
7. **Caching Layer** ‚Üí Redis stores processed data with TTL
8. **API Delivery** ‚Üí RESTful endpoints with optimized queries
9. **Frontend Display** ‚Üí Rich visualization with entity badges and detailed modals

## üöÄ Performance

- **Response Time**: <100ms API responses (cached)
- **Processing Speed**: 20 articles analyzed in ~1 seconds
- **Update Frequency**: 30-second staged article processing
- **Database Optimization**: Custom indexes for GUID, content, and processing status
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk inserts and updates for efficiency
- **Smart Filtering**: Pre-filters save ~90% of API calls
- **Caching**: Multi-layer strategy with automatic invalidation
